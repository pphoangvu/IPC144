1) In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus
parallel arrays when dealing with related data
When using an array of struct there are several advantages:
_ It is easier to add or delete or upgrade the data while parallel arrays it is hard and complex to locate the data index
_ It is convinient to control each member and object if there are something wrong.
2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain
why?
_When put source code in a header file, it is inserted that header file's code into the source file that requires that information. Therefore, when compiling multi-file and data source code it is duplicated inside each C file so we can write code as a construct.
